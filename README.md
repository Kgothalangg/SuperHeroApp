This was the first project ever, I had to re-do it after getting a taste of JavaScript.

The Super Hero App. Here I wanted a clean page, everything being on the page, hence I used the flip feature to add information about each hero at the back of their photo.
Because Marvel movies normally like dark scene, violance, I chose a dark theme for the home page. 
And place the heroes in line without the uniform nor a mask. 

I use a clip-path (One of my favorite photo styling way - I seems to keep adding it on my project. - Even my feeds are all about clip-path, thank you FNB | thank you IT Varsity.
I used circle and forcussed on the heroes faces, to add a soft feeling and really just connect with them as a human with feelings, not as people that we can risk in order to stay alive, 
of which is what they normally do when they wear a mask.

I added about me page to just put myself there, my qualification and my projects. 

So if you want to get hold pf me, reach me from there.
